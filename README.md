ukas-vlcek/bigdesk to support elasticsearch 6.X


## How to use Bigdesk

Open your web browser to access `http://127.0.0.1:9200/_plugin/bigdesk` by default.

Now you should see cluster name and list of its nodes. You can switch between nodes in the cluster, new nodes are added
and old nodes are removed automatically on the fly.

You can change the Bigdesk **refresh interval** and **amount of data** that is displayed by charts.
